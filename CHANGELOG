1.14.0:

VERY minimal, experimental Android support. Don't expect much from this yet.

Added new monitor mode KSCrashMonitorTypeManual, which effectively disables any automatic crash reporting.


1.13.3:

Fixed bad dynamic library reference in the Mac project file.

- ADDED   KSCrash.systemInfo

1.13.1:

Replaced backtrace system with stack walkers.
Moved more functionality into KSCrash.c.

- ADDED   KSCrashReportWriter.addTextFileLinesElement()
- ADDED   kscrash_notifyAppActive()
- ADDED   kscrash_notifyAppInForeground()
- ADDED   kscrash_notifyAppTerminate()
- ADDED   kscrash_notifyAppCrash()
- ADDED   kscrash_getReportCount()
- ADDED   kscrash_getReportIDs()
- ADDED   kscrash_readReport()
- ADDED   kscrash_addUserReport()
- ADDED   kscrash_deleteAllReports()


1.13.0:

Console logs are no longer visible when launched on a device without the debugger for some reason.
In order to get access to KSCrash logs, you can now add a copy of the logs to the new "debug" section in the crash report.

- REMOVED KSCrash.redirectConsoleLogToFile
- REMOVED KSCrash.printTraceToStdout
- ADDED   KSCrash.addConsoleLogToReport


1.12.0:

Moved the OS-specific code into leaf modules. All of the central modules from KSCrashC.c down are POSIX now.
Many of the lower level APIs have changed, and less headers are public.

- CHANGED [KSCrash reportUserException] now takes an additional parameter `logAllThreads`, which controls whether other threads are suspended and logged.
- ADDED   New monitor types, and a new default: KSCrashMonitorTypeProductionSafeMinimal. See KSCrashMonitorType.h


1.11.2:

Added buffered report file writing, giving a significant performance boost.


1.11.0:

Re-implemented most Objective-C functionality in POSIX C to prepare for porting. The following APIs have been changed/removed:

- RENAMED [KSCrash redirectConsoleLogsToDefaultFile] TO [KSCrash redirectConsoleLogToFile]
- REMOVED [KSCrash redirectConsoleLogsToFile:(NSString*) fullPath overwrite:(BOOL) overwrite]
- CHANGED kscrash_install() now only takes an app name and an install path.
- CHANGED kscrash_reinstall() no longer takes arguments.
- REMOVED KSCrash.maxStoredReports. Now stores 5 max always (g_maxReports in KSCrashReportStore.c)
- REMOVED [KSCrash allReports]
- REMOVED [KSCrash initWithReportFilesDirectory]
- REMOVED KSCrash.crashReportStore
